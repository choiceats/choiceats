## Minimum Viable Product
TODO
* Edit recipes
  * Must pick existing units.
  * Must pick existing ingredients.
  * Instructions - Basic text for now. Rich text later.

DONE
* Display recipes
* Authentication
* Delete recipes
* Filter recipes by likes (youlike and then overall)
* Server side converter to display fractions instead of decimals

## Backlog
* Dictionary of plural/single ingredients on server side (i.e. eggs);

### Missing Ingredients
* Ground pork

### Ingredients to fix
* apple slices. large apples, sliced
* unitless ingredients may need to display quantity sometimes but not other times. e.g. ketchup would not show quantity, but eggs would
